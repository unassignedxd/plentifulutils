# plentiful Utilities
A mod that adds a bunch of random things.
Currently, this mod is work in progress and not availble for release. However, here is the list of added things:
 > Void Energy System
    -> Addition of 'void' to chunks that can be manupulated and extrapolated to generate power/items. However, be careful, as an unstable void enivroment is dangerous.
    * Void Sensor
    * Void Annihilator
